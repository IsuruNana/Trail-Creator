# Trail-Creator
This program reads a set of elevation data and: 1. Generates a simple image from this elevation data, a black-and-white image where higher elevations have a darker shade than lower elevations. 2. Identifies a path across this grid. The path can be North-to-South, South-to-North, East-to-West, or West-to-East. To find this path, the program minimizes the elevation gain (climb). In other words, you donâ€™t want to walk uphill any more than necessary. Instead, you want to go downhill as much as possible, a steep downhill path is viewed as optimal. A second image file with the recommended trail will be generated.
